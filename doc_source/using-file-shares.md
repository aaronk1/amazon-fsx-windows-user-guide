# Using Microsoft Windows file shares<a name="using-file-shares"></a>

A Microsoft Windows *file share* is a specific folder in your file system\. It includes that folder's subfolders, which you make accessible to your compute instances with the Server Message Block \(SMB\) protocol\. Your file system comes with a default Windows file share, named `share`\. You can create and manage as many other Windows file shares as you want by using the Windows graphical user interface \(GUI\) tool named *Shared Folders*\.

## Accessing file shares<a name="accessing-file-shares"></a>

To access your file shares, you use the Windows Map Network Drive functionality to map a drive letter on your compute instance to your Amazon FSx file share\. The process of mapping a file share to a drive on your compute instance is known as *mounting* a file share in Linux\. This process differs depending on the type of compute instance and the operating system\. After your file share is mapped, your applications and users can access files and folders on your file share as if they are local files and folders\.

Following are procedures for mapping a file share on the different supported compute instances\.

   ```
   $ sudo yum install cifs-utils
   ```

1. Create the mount point directory **/mnt/fsx**\. This is where you will mount the Amazon FSx file system\.

   ```
   $ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx
   ```

1. Authenticate with kerberos using the following command\.

   ```
   $ kinit
   ```

1. Mount the file share with the following command\.

   ```
   $ sudo mount -t cifs //file_system_dns_name/file_share mount_point --verbose -o vers=SMB_version,sec=krb5,cruid=ad_user,rsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,wsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,cache=none,ip=preferred-file-server-Ip
   ```

    You can find the DNS name on the [Amazon FSx console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx) by choosing **Windows File Server**, **Network & security**\. Or, you can find them in the response of `CreateFileSystem` or `DescribeFileSystems` API operation\.

+ `rsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,wsize=CIFSMaxBufSize` â Specifies the read and write buffer size as the maximum allowed by the CIFS protocol\. Replace `CIFSMaxBufSize` with the largest value allowed by your kernel\. Determine the `CIFSMaxBufSize` by running the following command\.

  ```
  $ modinfo cifs | grep CIFSMaxBufSize
  parm:           CIFSMaxBufSize:Network buffer size (not including header). Default: 16384 Range: 8192 to 130048 (uint)
  ```

  The output shows that the maximum buffer size is 130048\.
+ `cache=none` â Sets the CIFS cache mode to none, that is, to not cache file data at all\.
+ `ip=preferred-file-server-Ip` â Sets the destination IP address to that of the file system's preferred file server\.

  You can retrieve the file system's preferred file server IP address as follows:
  + Using the Amazon FSx console, on the **Network & security** tab of the **File system details** page\.

#### To Mount a File Share on an Amazon EC2 Linux Instance Not Joined to Your Active Directory<a name="map-file-share-ec2-linux-command"></a>

The following procedure mounts an Amazon FSx file share to an Amazon EC2 Linux instance that is not joined to your Active Directory \(AD\)\. For an EC2 Linux instance that is *not* joined to your Active Directory, you can only mount an FSx for Windows File Server file share by using its private IP address\. You can get the file system's private IP address using the [Amazon FSx console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx), on the **Network & security** tab, in **Preferred File Server IP Address**\.

 This example uses NTLM authentication\. To do this, you mount the file system as a user that is a member of the Microsoft Active Directory domain that the FSx for Windows File Server file system is joined to\. The credentials for the user account are provided in a text file that you create on your EC2 instance, `creds.txt`\. This file contains the user name, password, and domain for the user\.

```
$ cat creds.txt
username=user1
password=Password123
domain=EXAMPLE.COM
```

**To launch and configure the Amazon Linux EC2 instance**

   ```
   $ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx
   ```

1. Create the `creds.txt` credentials file in the `/home/ec2-user` directory, using the format shown previously\.

1. Set the `creds.txt` file permissions so that only you \(the owner\) can read and write to the file by running the following command\.

   ```
   $ chmod 700 creds.txt
   ```<a name="mnt-ip-addr"></a>

**To mount the file system**

1. You mount a file share not joined to your Active Directory by using its private IP address\. You can get the file system's private IP address using the [Amazon FSx console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx), on the **Network & security** tab, in the **Preferred File Server IP Address**\. 

1. Mount the file system using the following command:

   ```
   $ sudo mount -t cifs //file-system-IP-address/file_share /mnt/fsx --verbose -o vers=SMB_version,sec=ntlmsspi,cred=/home/ec2-user/creds.txt,rsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,wsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,cache=none
   ```

### Automatically mounting file shares on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance not joined to your Active Directory<a name="automount-fsxw-ec2-linux"></a>

You can automatically mount your FSx for Windows File Server file share whenever the Amazon EC2 Linux instance to which it's mounted reboots\. To do so, add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file on the EC2 instance\. The `/etc/fstab` file contains information about file systems\. The command mount \-a, which runs during instance startup, mounts the file systems listed in the `/etc/fstab` file\. 

For an Amazon Linux EC2 instance that is not joined to your Active Directory, you can only mount an FSx for Windows File Server file share by using its private IP address\. You can get the file system's private IP address using the [Amazon FSx console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx), on the **Network & security** tab, in **Preferred File Server IP Address**\.

The following procedure uses Microsoft NTLM authentication\. You mount the file system as a user that is a member of the Microsoft Active Directory domain to which the FSx for Windows File Server file system is joined\. The credentials for the user account are provided in the text file `creds.txt`\. This file contains the user name, password, and domain for the user\.

```
$ cat creds.txt
username=user1
password=Password123
domain=EXAMPLE.COM
```

#### To automatically mount a file share on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance not joined to your Active Directory<a name="automount-ec2-linux-ip"></a>

**To launch and configure the Amazon Linux EC2 instance**

1. Launch an Amazon Linux EC2 instance using the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2)\. For more information, see [Launch an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

1. Connect to your instance\. For more information, see [Connect to your Linux instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

1. Run the following command to install the `cifs-utils` package\. This package is used to mount network file systems like Amazon FSx on Linux\.

   ```
   $ sudo yum install cifs-utils
   ```

1. Create the `/mnt/fsx` directory\. This is where you will mount the Amazon FSx file system\.

   ```
   $ sudo mkdir /mnt/fsx
   ```

1. Create the `creds.txt` credentials file in the `/home/ec2-user` directory\.

1. Set the file permissions so that only you \(the owner\) can read the file by running the following command\.

   ```
   $ sudo chmod 700 creds.txt
   ```

**To automatically mount the file system**

1. You automatically mount a file share not joined to your Active Directory by using its private IP address\. You can get the file system's private IP address from the [Amazon FSx console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx), in the **Network & security** tab, the **Preferred File Server IP Address**\.

1. To automatically mount the file share using its private IP address, add the following line to the `/etc/fstab` file\.

   ```
   //file-system-IP-address/file_share /mnt/fsx cifs vers=SMB_version,sec=ntlmsspi,cred=/home/ec2-user/creds.txt,rsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,wsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,cache=none
   ```

   Replace `CIFSMaxBufSize` with the largest value allowed by your kernel\. Run the following command to get this value\.

   ```
   $ modinfo cifs | grep CIFSMaxBufSize
   parm:           CIFSMaxBufSize:Network buffer size (not including header). Default: 16384 Range: 8192 to 130048 (uint)
   ```

   The output shows that the maximum buffer size is 130048\.

1. Test the `fstab` entry by using the `mount` command with the 'fake' option in conjunction with the 'all' and 'verbose' options\.

   ```
   $ sudo mount -fav
   home/ec2-user/fsx      : successfully mounted
   ```

1. To mount the file share, reboot the Amazon EC2 instance\.

1. When the instance is available again, verify that the file system is mounted by running the following command\.

   ```
   $ sudo mount -l -t cifs
   //file-system-IP-address/file_share on /mnt/fsx type cifs (rw,relatime,vers=SMB_version,sec=ntlmsspi,cache=strict,username=user1,domain=CORP.EXAMPLE.COM,uid=0,noforceuid,gid=0,noforcegid,addr=192.0.20.0,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,soft,nounix,serverino,mapposix,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,echo_interval=60,actimeo=1)
   ```

   The line added to the `/etc/fstab` file in this procedure does the following at the given points:
   + `//file-system-IP-address/file_share` â Specifies the IP address and share of the Amazon FSx file system you're mounting\.
   + `/mnt/fsx` â Specifies the mount point for the Amazon FSx file system on your EC2 instance\.
   + `cifs vers=SMB_version` â Specifies the type of file system as CIFS and the SMB protocol version\. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server supports SMB versions 2\.0 through 3\.1\.1\.
   + `sec=ntlmsspi` â Specifies using NT LAN Manager Security Support Provider Interface to facilitate NTLM challenge\-response authentication\.
   + `cred=/home/ec2-user/creds.txt` â Specifies where to get the user credentials\.
