# Using Amazon FSx with AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory<a name="fsx-aws-managed-ad"></a>

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory \(AWS Managed Microsoft AD\) provides fully managed, highly available, actual Active Directory \(AD\) directories in the cloud\. You can use these AD directories in your workload deployment\. 

If your organization is using AWS Managed Microsoft AD to manage identities and devices, we recommend that you integrate your Amazon FSx file system with AWS Managed Microsoft AD\. By doing this, you get a turnkey solution using Amazon FSx with AWS Managed Microsoft AD\. AWS handles the deployment, operation, high availability, reliability, security, and seamless integration of the two services, enabling you to focus on operating your own workload effectively\.

To use Amazon FSx with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD setup, you can use the Amazon FSx console\. When you create a new FSx for Windows File Server file system in the console, choose **AWS Managed AD** under the **Windows Authentication** section\. You also choose the specific directory that you want to use\. For more information, see [Step 1: Create your file system](getting-started-step1.md)\. 

Your organization might manage identities and devices on a self\-managed Active Directory domain \(on\-premises or in the cloud\)\. If so, you can join your Amazon FSx file system directly to your existing, self\-managed AD domain\. For more information, see [Using Amazon FSx with your self\-managed Microsoft Active Directory](self-managed-AD.md)\. 

Additionally, you can also set up your system to benefit from a resource forest isolation model\. In this model, you isolate your resources, including your Amazon FSx file systems, into a separate AD forest from the one where your users are\. 

**Important**  
For Single\-AZ 2 and all Multi\-AZ file systems, the Active Directory domain name cannot exceed 47 characters\.

## Networking prerequisites<a name="rfim-networking-requirements"></a>

Before you create an FSx for Windows File Server file system joined to your AWS Microsoft Managed AD domain, make sure that you have created and set up the following network configurations:
+ For **VPC security groups**, the default security group for your default Amazon VPC is already added to your file system in the console\. Please ensure that the security group and the VPC Network ACLs for the subnet\(s\) where you're creating your FSx file system allow traffic on the ports and in the directions shown in the following diagram\.  
![\[FSx for Windows File Server port configuration requirements for VPC security groups and network ACLs for the subnets where the file system is being created.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/images/Windows-port-requirements.png)

  The following table identifies the role of each port\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/fsx-aws-managed-ad.html)
**Important**  
Allowing outbound traffic on TCP port 9389 is required for Single\-AZ 2 and all Multi\-AZ file system deployments\.
**Note**  
If you're using VPC network ACLs, you must also allow outbound traffic on dynamic ports \(49152\-65535\) from your FSx file system\.
+ If you are connecting your Amazon FSx file system to an AWS Managed Microsoft AD in a different VPC or account, then ensure connectivity between that VPC and the Amazon VPC where you want to create the file system\. For more information, see [Using Amazon FSx with AWS Managed Microsoft AD in a different VPC or account](shared-mad.md)\.
**Important**  
While Amazon VPC security groups require ports to be opened only in the direction that network traffic is initiated, VPC network ACLs require ports to be open in both directions\.

Use the [Amazon FSx Network Validation tool](validate-ad-domain-controllers.md#test-ad-controller-connectivity) to validate connectivity to your Active Directory domain controllers\.

## Using a resource forest isolation model<a name="using-a-rfim"></a>

You join your file system to an AWS Managed Microsoft AD setup\. You then establish a one\-way forest trust relationship between an AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain that you create and your existing self\-managed AD domain\. For Windows authentication in Amazon FSx, you only need a one\-way directional forest trust, where the AWS managed forest trusts the corporate domain forest\.

Your corporate domain takes the role of the trusted domain, and the AWS Directory Service managed domain takes the role of the trusting domain\. Validated authentication requests travel between the domains in only one directionâ€”allowing accounts in your corporate domain to authenticate against resources shared in the managed domain\. In this case, Amazon FSx interacts only with the managed domain\. The managed domain then passes on the authentication requests to your corporate domain\.

## Test your Active Directory configuration<a name="test-ad-config"></a>

Before creating your Amazon FSx file system, we recommend that you validate the connectivity to your Active Directory domain controllers using the Amazon FSx Network Validation tool\. For more information, see [Validating connectivity to your Active Directory domain controllers](validate-ad-domain-controllers.md)\.
